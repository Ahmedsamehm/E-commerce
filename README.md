## E-commerce Website

A full-featured e-commerce platform built during my early React learning journey. The website displays products and allows users to browse the homepage, but requires login to place orders. 

### Features
- **User Authentication**: Complete registration, login, and password reset functionality with email verification codes
- **Product Browsing**: Browse products on the homepage without authentication
- **Order Management**: Authenticated users can place and manage orders
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `memo` for improved performance
- **State Management**: Used Context API for efficient data sharing across components

### Technologies Used
- **React 18** - Core library with performance optimizations
- **Routing** - React Router DOM v7
- **Styling** - Tailwind CSS v3.4.17
- **Forms** - Formik with Yup validation
- **HTTP Client** - Axios v1.7.9
- **Authentication** - React JWT v1.2.2
- **UI Components** - React Slick, Swiper, and React Responsive Carousel
